        <h1>JavaScript Arrays</h1>
        <p>An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value:</p>
        <p style="color: crimson;"><b>const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];</b></p>

        <p id="demo"></p>
        <script>
            const flowers = ["Rose", "Lotus", "Lilly", "Sunflower"];
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = flowers;
        </script>

        <hr>

        <h2>Why Use Arrays?</h2>
        <p>If you have a list of items (a list of flower names, for example), storing the flowers in single variables could look like this:</p>
        <p style="color: crimson;">let flower1 = "Rose";  <br>
            let flower2 = "Lotus";  <br>
            let flower3 = "Lilly";  <br>
            let flower4 = "Sunflower";
        </p>

        <p>However, what if you want to loop through the flowers and find a specific one? And what if you had not 4 flowers, but 400 different flowers?</p>
        <p>The solution is an array!</p>
        <p>An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.</p>
