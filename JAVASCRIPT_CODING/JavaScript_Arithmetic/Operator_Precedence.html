        <h1>Operator Precedence</h1>
        <p>Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression.</p>
        
        <h3>What is the BODMAS rule? <br>
            The BODMAS rule follows the order of the BODMAS acronym: <br>
            B – Brackets<br>
            O – Order of powers or roots <br>
            D – Division <br>
            M – Multiplication <br>
            A – Addition <br>
            S – Subtraction.
        </h3>
        
        <p>Multiplication has precedence over addition.</p>
       
        <p id="demo"></p>

        <script>
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 100 + 80 * 4;
        </script>

        <br><hr><br>

        <p>Division has precedence over subtraction.</p>

        <p id="demo2"></p>

        <script>
            document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = 100 - 80 / 4;
        </script>

        <br><hr><br>

        <p>Is the result of example above the same as 150 * 3, or is it the same as 100 + 150?</p>
        <p>Is the addition or the multiplication done first?</p>
        <p>As in traditional school mathematics, the multiplication is done first.</p>
        <p>Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).</p>
        
        
        <br><hr><br>

        <p>And (as in school mathematics) the precedence can be changed by using parentheses.</p>
        <p>When using parentheses, the operations inside the parentheses are computed first:</p>
        <p>Multiplication has precedence over addition.</p>
        <p>But parenthesis has precedence over multiplication.</p>

        <p id ="demo3"></p>

        <script>
            document.getElementById('demo3').innerHTML = (500 + 90) * 6;
        </script>

        <br><hr><br>

        <p>When many operations has the same precedence, they are computed from left to right.</p>
        
        <p id="demo4"></p>

        <script>
            document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML = (500 / 90) * 6;
        </script>
    </body>
