        <h1>JavaScript Data Types</h1>
        <p>JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".</p>
        <p>In programming, text values are called text strings.</p>
        <p>JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.</p>
        <p>Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.</p>
        <p>If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.</p>
        
        <p>Strings are written with quotes.</p>
        <p>Numbers are written without quotes.</p>
