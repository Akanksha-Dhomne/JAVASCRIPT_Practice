        <h1>JavaScript Identifiers</h1>
        <p>All JavaScript <b>variables</b> must be <b>identified</b> with <b>unique names</b>.</p>
        <p>These unique names are called <b>identifiers</b>.</p>
        <p>Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).</p>
        <p>The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.</li>
            <li>Names must begin with a letter.</li>
            <li>Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).</li>
            <li>Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).</li>
            <li>Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>NOTE:</p>
        <p>JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.</p>

        <h1>The Assignment Operator</h1>
        <p>In JavaScript, the equal sign <b>(=)</b> is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.</p>
        <p>This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra:</p>
        <p>x = x + 8</p>
        <p>In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x.</p>
        <p>(It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented by 5.)</p>
        <p>The "equal to" operator is written like <b>==</b> in JavaScript.</p>
