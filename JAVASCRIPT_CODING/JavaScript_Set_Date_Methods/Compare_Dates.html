        <h1>Compare Dates</h1>
        <p>Dates can easily be compared.</p>
        <p>The following example compares today's date with January 14, 2100:</p>

        <p id="demo"></p>
        <script>
            let text;
            const today = new Date();
            const someday = new Date();
            someday.setFullYear(2100, 0, 14);

            if(someday > today) {
                text = "Today is before January 14, 2100.";
            }
            else{
                text = "Today is after January 14, 2100.";
            }
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text; 
        </script>

        <p>JavaScript counts months from 0 to 11. January is 0. December is 11.</p>
