        <h1>JavaScript Arrays</h1>
        <p>JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.</p>
        <p>Array items are separated by commas.</p>
        <p>The following code declares (creates) an array called cars, containing three items (car names):</p>
       
        <p id="demo"></p>

        <script>
            const cars = ["Volvo", "Maruti", "BMW"]            
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars[0];
        </script>

        <p>Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], second is [1], and so on.</p>
