        <h1>JavaScript Strings</h1>
        <p>A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".</p>
        <p>Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:</p>

        <p id="demo"></p>
        <script>
            let carName1 = "Volvo";
            let carName2 = 'Volvo';               
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName1 + "<br>" + carName2;
        </script>

        <br><hr><br>

        <p>You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:</p>

        <p id="demo2"></p>
        <script>
            let answer1 = "It's alright";
            let answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
            let answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';
            let answer4 = "He is called \"Johnny\"";
            let answer5 = 'He is called \'Johnny\'';
            
            document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML =
            answer1 + "<br>" + answer2 + "<br>" + answer3 + "<br>" + answer4 + "<br>" + answer5;
        </script>
