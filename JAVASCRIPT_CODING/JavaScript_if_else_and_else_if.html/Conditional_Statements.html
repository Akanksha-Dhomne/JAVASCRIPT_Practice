        <p>Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.</p>

        <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
        <p>Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.</p>

        <p>In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>if specifies a block of code to be excuted, if the condition is true</li>
            <li>else specifies a block of code to be excuted, if the condition is false</li>
            <li>else if specifies a new condition to test, if the first condition is false</li>
            <li>switch specifies many alternative blocks of code to be executed</li>
        </ul>
